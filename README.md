## Summary

In this project I followed along with a tutorial to create a full e-commerce site using Next JS. I also configured MUI for styled components. I used MongoDb for the backend database and setup a payment system using PayPal. User sessions are also stored using cookies and JWT. Finally I used Vercel to deploy my application.
